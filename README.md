Dice_Simulator is an application that generates a random number on the dice automatically on the dice when a button is triggered.<br>
Dice_Simulator generates a random number between 1 to 6.<br>
This works just like a real life dice and it is used in several games like Ludo, Snake and Ladders etc.<br>
