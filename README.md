Author - Ganga Waggya<br>
Dice_Simulator is an application that generates a random number on the dice automatically on the dice when a button is triggered. 
Dice_Simulator generates a random number between 0 to 6.
This works just like a real life dice and it is used in several games like Ludo, Snake and Ladders etc.
